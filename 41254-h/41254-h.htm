<h3>
<span>THE TREDESCANTS AND ELIAS ASHMOLE.<br />
(<i>Continued from</i> p. 368.)</span>
</h3>



<p>Whether it was Ashmole's influence, or that the equity of the case was
on his side, is uncertain; but the Court of Chancery decided in his
favour, and he was declared the proprietor of the Tredescantian Museum.
He obtained, without being able to produce any written document which
declared his right to the possession, all that the two Tredescants,
father and son, had with inexpressible trouble, and by means of many
voyages, brought together in their Museum and Botanic Garden.</p>

<p>The judgement of the Lord Chancellor<a id="lor1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (Clarendon) was:</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"He, Ashmole, shall have and enjoy all and singular the bookes,
   coynes, medalls, stones, pictures, mechanicks, and antiquities,
   and all and every other the raryties and curiosities, of what
   sort or kind soever, whether naturall or artificiall, which were
   in John Tredescant's Closett, or in or about his house at South
   Lambeth the 16th December, 1659, and which were commonly deemed,
   taken, and reputed as belonging or appertaining to the said
   Closett, or Collection of Rarities, an abstract whereof was
   heretofore printed under the tytle of 'Museum Tredescantianum.'"</p>


<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#lor1" class="label">[1]</a> "The means of exhibiting Lord Clarendon as an equity
judge," says Mr. Lister, "and of estimating his efficiency, are very
scanty. The political functions of the Lord Chancellor then
preponderated over the judicial functions much more than at present." He
had for twenty years ceased to practise at the bar, and the very
different avocations of that long period may have tended to unfit him.
It is said that he never made a decree without the assistance of two of
the judges: this implies a consciousness of want of knowledge, but, as
his biographer says, "does not prove that the precaution was required."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tredescant was adjudged to have merely during her life a kind of
custody of, or guardianship over the collection, "subject to the Trust
for the Defendant during her life."</p>

<p>The Lord Chancellor further decreed that a commission should be named to
inquire whether everything was forthcoming which was named in the
<i>Catalogue</i>; in order that if anything was missing she should be
constrained to replace it, and give security that nothing should be lost
in future. The commissioners appointed to carry into effect the
Chancellor's decree were however two persons with whom Ashmole must have
been on terms of intimate friendship, namely, Sir Edward Bysh and<a id="Page_386"></a> <span class="pagenum">[386]</span>
Sir William Dugdale, both Heralds like himself; and with the latter he
at length became most intimately connected by marrying his daughter. To
them was also added, in his official capacity, Sir William Glascock, a
Master in Chancery. Tredescant's widow, as may be imagined, did not very
quietly submit to this, as it seemed to her, unjust decree; but all her
endeavours at opposition were fruitless; she was constrained to yield;
and it seems probable that the depressing influence of this struggle
affected her so much as to cause her death. She was found drowned in the
pond in the garden cultivated by her husband and his father at South
Lambeth, on the 3rd of April, 1678.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the legal or equitable right of Ashmole, upon
which the decree in Chancery was founded, it is impossible for a
generous mind to come to any other conclusion than that the course he
pursued was unworthy of him as a man of education, and of his wealth and
station; for it must be obvious from the will of Tredescant, that even
supposing he had willingly and wittingly made a deed of gift of his
treasures to Ashmole, and given him formal possession by handing over
the Queen Elizabeth's shilling, it is next to impossible to believe that
Ashmole did not know that he repented that act, and wished to connect
his own name with the bequest to the University. Dr. Hamel<a id="mel2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is induced
to think that many of Tredescant's curiosities were never sent to
Oxford; that there had been a careful suppression of every written
document which might serve to connect the name of the Tredescants with
the collection; and that the relation of the voyage to Russia only
escaped because it bore no mark by which it could be recognised as
Tradescant's.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#mel2" class="label">[2]</a> Dr. Hamel sought in vain at the Ashmolean Museum for some
of the articles which the elder Tredescant brought home from Russia;
among others, for an article occurring at p. 46. of the <i>Tredescant
Catalogue</i>, described as "The Duke of Muscovy's vest, wrought with gold
upon the breast and arms," which he thinks may have belonged to the
Wojewode of Archangel, Wassiljewitch Chilkow. He however found nothing
but the head of a Sea-diver, the remains of a whole bird described by
Tredescant as a "Gorara or Colymbus from Muscovy:" the body seems to
have shared the same fate as that of the Dodo. Another remarkable
article occurring in the Catalogue is pointed out by Dr. Hamel, viz.
"Blood that rained in the Isle of Wight, attested by Sir Jo. Oglander."
This article, had it been preserved, he thinks might have proved of
great scientific importance, as it is possible that it may have been
some of that meteoric red dust which is recorded in the <i>Chronicle of
Bromton</i> as having fallen in the Isle of Wight in the year 1177. The
words of the Chronicle are: "Anno 1177 die Dominica post Pentecostes
sanguineus imber cecidit in insula de <i>Whit</i>, fere per duas hores
integras, ita quod panni linei per sepes ad siccandum suspensi, rore
illo sanguineo sic aspersi fuerant acsi in vaso aliquo pleno sanguine
mersi essent." Sir John Oglander, whose attestation is mentioned, was
the immediate descendant of Richard de Okelander, who came over with
William the Conqueror. Tredescant most probably became known to him when
gardener to the Duke of Buckingham, with whom Sir John was joint
commissioner for levies in Hampshire.</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"The more we examine the <i>Catalogue of the Museum
   Tredescantianum</i>," says Dr. Hamel, "the more we are astonished
   that it was possible for these <i>Gardeners</i> (for such, we see, is
   the modest denomination the younger Tredescant assumes in his
   will) to get together so many and such various objects of
   curiosity, and to become the founders of the first collection of
   curiosities of Nature and Art in England."</p>


<p>Such men, and their endeavours to promote a love for, and to advance
natural science, deserved at least to have had their names perpetuated
with their collection; and whatever may be the merits of Ashmole as an
antiquary, notwithstanding I am one of the fraternity, I must confess
that although he has some claim to consideration for having augmented
the collection, the Tredescants rank far above him as benefactors of
mankind.</p>

<p>The mention, in the will of Robert and Thomas Tredescant, of
Walberswick, in the county of Suffolk, is, I think, decisive that the
elder Tredescant was an Englishman. In the relation of his voyage to
Russia he shows that he was familiar with the aspect of the two
adjoining counties of Essex and Norfolk. Dr. Hamel has directed his
inquiries toward the registry of the church at Walberswick, in which he
was aided by Mr. Ellis of Southwold; but unfortunately the existing
register commences a century too late, the first entry being of the year
1756. In Gardner's <i>Historical Account of Dunwich, Blithburg, and
Southwold</i>, 1754, there are notices of Walberswick, but the name of
Tredescant does not occur.</p>

<p>I have just learned that the late M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. T<span class="smcap lowercase">RADESCANT</span> L<span class="smcap lowercase">AY</span> claimed descent
from the Tredescants; and it seems probable that it was through the

bequest. Ashmole may have written <i>Lea</i> for <i>Lay</i>, or the name, as often
happens, may have assumed the latter form in the lapse of time.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Mr. Tradescant Lay was the <i>Naturalist</i> attached
to Beechey's expedition, and published <i>The Voyage of the Himmaleh</i>. He
went subsequently to China, on account of the missions, but afterwards
received an appointment under the government (probably that of
interpreter). In the year 1841 he put forth an interesting little work,
entitled <i>The Chinese as they are</i>; and he was at least worthy of the
descent he claimed.</p>

<p>I have only to add, that I have not seen the original will, or the
documentary evidence in the suit in Chancery. Desirous of losing no time
in this<a id="Page_387"></a> <span class="pagenum">[387]</span> communication, which is not without interest at the
present moment, as it may influence the tribute about to be paid to the
memory of the Tredescants by the reparation of their monuments, I have
relied on Dr. Hamel's transcripts.</p>

<p>One is gratified to find that the merits of these humble and
unpretending lovers of science is at length appreciated, and that, while
some of the inhabitants of Lambeth, where they dwelt, are taking
effective measures to restore the monument erected to their memory by
the unfortunate Hester, a just tribute to their merits has been paid by
Dr. Hamel at St. Petersburg! On Ashmole's tombstone in Lambeth Church is
inscribed: "Mortem obiit 18 Maii, 1692, sed durante Musæo Ashmoleano
Oxonii nunquam moriturus." May not some similar record relate to
posterity that it was to the Tredescants we owe the foundation of the
first Museum of Curiosities of Nature and Art, as well as the first
Botanic Garden?</p>

<h3>
<span>INEDITED POETRY.</span>
</h3>

<p>I have now before me an interesting little volume containing "Elegiac
Verses" and other poetical effusions, composed by, and in the autograph
of, Anne Ellys, wife and widow of a Bishop of St. David's. Most of the
pieces are dated, the earliest in January, 1761, the latest February 15,
1763. The MS. is in small 4to. and contains fifteen pieces, eleven of
which relate to the death of her husband (which occurred, so far as I
can gather from the dates, on January 17th, 1761), and breathe a spirit
of deep affection and of fervent piety. So far as I am aware, the poems
have never been published; permit me to send you one of the pieces, as
it may be deemed worthy of a place in the museum of inedited poetry
already collected in your pages, and which I hope to see greatly
increased.</p>

  <p>    "The mind of man, like a luxuriant field,</p>
      <p>Will various products, in abundance, yield.</p>
   <p>   If cultur'd well by skilful gardener's hand,</p>
      <p>What beauteous prospects overspread the land.</p>
     <p> What various flowers to the sight appear,</p>
     <p> To deck each season of the rolling year.</p>
     <p> Their od'rous scents the opening buds disclose,&nbsp;&nbsp;       }</p>
     <p> From the blew [sic] violet to the blushing rose,&nbsp;&nbsp;      }</p>
      <p>And each in its successive order blows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               }</p>
     <p> Each different fragrance yields a fresh delight,</p>
      <p>And various colours charm the ravish'd sight.</p>
     <p> Unnumber'd fruits as well as flowers arise,</p>
 <p>     To please the taste, and to delight the eyes.</p>
     <p> The blooming peach tempts the beholder's hand,</p>
    <p>  And curling vines in beauteous order stand;</p>
      <p>Their purple clusters to the sight disclose,</p>
      <p>While ruddy apples with vermillion glows [sic].</p>
<p>      Fancy and order makes the whole complete,</p>
      <p>Not costly elegance, yet exactly neat.</p>
      <p>Delightful scene, produce of care and pains,</p>
      <p>Late wild and dreary were these beauteous plains.</p>
      <p>And should they now again neglected be,&nbsp;&nbsp;      }</p>
     <p> How soon, alas, would the beholder see,&nbsp;&nbsp;      }</p>
     <p> Instead of order, wild deformity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            }</p>
      <p>Let this, my soul, incline thee to reflect,</p>
      <p>The fatal consequence of sad neglect.</p>
     <p> Thy mind like this sweet spot thou may'st improve,</p>
     <p> And make it worthy of its Maker's love.</p>
      <p>Observe thyself with nicest care, thy pain</p>
    <p>  And present labour will be future gain.</p>
     <p> Let no ill weeds arise lest they destroy,</p>
      <p>The seeds of virtue which alone yield joy.</p>
      <p>Manure thy soul with every lovely grace,</p>
     <p> No more let sin thy heaven-born soul deface.</p>
      <p>Nor idle or inactive, let it be;</p>
     <p> By this example warn'd, observe and see</p>
   <p>   How from the least neglect great dangers rise.</p>
      <p>Watch lest the nipping frost of sin surprise,</p>
      <p>Or gusts of passion with impetuous sway,</p>
      <p>Bear down thy good resolves, or then delay.</p>
      <p>As scorching suns destroy the new set tree,</p>
     <p> And burn the tender plant in infancy;</p>
    <p>  So jealous of thy own improvements be,</p>
     <p> Lest they should fill thy mind with vanity,</p>
      <p>Check its too speedy growth, observe and see</p>
     <p> How the too early buds all blasted be.</p>
      <p>And as all human care and labour's vain,</p>
      <p>Without the vernal breeze and gentle rain;</p>
     <p> So when thy utmost care and skill is shown,</p>
     <p> Reflect it is not thou, but God alone</p>
     <p> Whose heavenly grace, distilling on thy soul,</p>
      <p>Must all the wild disorders there controul.</p>
   <p>   Pray for the beams of his celestial light,</p>
     <p> To clear the errours of thy misty sight.</p>
     <p> So thy endeavours and God's grace conjoin'd,</p>
      <p>Will towards perfection lead the willing mind.</p>

<p>This piece is the second in the collection, several of the other poems
are signed with the author's name at full length: the last piece appears
to be written under a presentiment of impending death; its heading is
somewhat curious:</p>


  <p class="blockquot">"February 15th [1763], past 2 in the morning. Going to bed very
   ill."</p>

<p>This leads me to inquire the date of her death. Should any further

<h3>
<span>NOTE ON VIRGIL.</span>

<div class="poem">
      <p>"Ecce <i>levis</i> summo de vertice visus Iüli</p>
      <p>Fundere lumen <i>apex</i>...."</p>

</div>

<p>The common translations of <i>apex</i> with its epithet <i>levis</i> seem to me to
be strangely deficient in sense. I am anxious to submit an idea which
has occurred to me to the judgment of the riper scholars whose
well-known names are subscribed to so many valuable articles in "N. &amp;
Q." The Delphin note defines <i>apex</i> to be "summa pars pilei," the
conical termination of the bonnet worn by Iülus; and in this all other
comments on this passage (at least with which I am acquainted) seem to
agree. But in what sense can any part of a cap or bonnet be
<i>levis</i>&mdash;<i>light</i>, <i>flimsy</i>, <i>worthless</i>, or <i>capricious</i>? which I take
to be the only meanings of which <i>levis</i> is capable. Surely Virgil would
not be guilty of so meaningless an epithet&mdash;of so palpable an instance
of school-boy <i>cram</i>? Now, from a passage in Euripides, <i>Ph&oelig;n.</i>

<h3>
<span>MSS. OF DR. WHITBY, AND PETITION OF INHABITANTS OF ALLINGTON, KENT.</span>
</h3>

<p>Perhaps some of your numerous readers may be interested with the
following Note:&mdash;A few weeks since I met with at a stall a most
beautifully-written MS. commentary on the Second Epistle of St. Paul to
the Corinthians. The MS. was evidently of the close of the seventeenth,
or the first three or four years of the eighteenth century. I was much
struck with its learning. At the end were two sermons written in a
different hand. The commentary was scored and corrected by the same hand
the sermons were written in. These latter were full of most copious
extracts from the Greek and Latin Fathers. The handwriting was very
remarkable. I discovered that the commentary was that of Dr. Whitby,
though differing in several places from that published by him. By a
comparison with some of Dr. Whitby's letters in the British Museum
(especially Add. MSS. 4276., fol. 194.), two learned friends at once
identified the Doctor's handwriting, which is very peculiar in the
formation of some of the letters, and especially from having a
remarkable curve [Illustration: horizontal curved line]. The two
sermons, I believe, have never been published. Between the leaves of the
MS. I found an old letter, of which I send you a copy. The person to
whom it was addressed was Dr. Elias Sydall, subsequently, I believe,
Bishop of Gloucester, then chaplain to Archbishop Tenison. I know not
whether it has ever appeared in print before.</p>




<p class="blockquot"> "To the Pious and Rev<span class="topnum">d</span> D<span class="topnum">r</span> Sydall, Chaplain to his
      Grace the Archbp. of Canterbury.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The sublime character his Grace did latelie bestow on a <i>brace</i>

   loose against any two preachers in England</i>, has rais'd so high
   an opinion of your person in all men of sense and understanding,
   that you cannot wonder to see yourself courted by us as the
   reigning favourite at Lambeth; be pleas'd, therefore, when
   business of State or the care of the Church aford his Grace some
   minutes of leisure, to represent our deplorable case to Him: we
   are now as a flock without a Shepheard, and are inform'd by a
   threat'ning Emissary, who came latelie down only to scatter
   terror through our fields, that my L<span class="topnum">d</span> designs to thrust a young

   the great Erasmus, &amp; that our living should not be the portion of
   Sucklings: His Grace's singular affection to the Church will
   encline him, we hope, to consider our case, and we entreat you to
   favor it with your gracious countenance; and your Petitioners
   will, as in duty bound, pray to God that he will be pleas'd to
   translate one of the Prebendaries to Heaven, to make room for you
   before it is too late.</p>

<h3>
<span>SIR RALPH VERNON.</span>
</h3>

<p>Much has been written in "N. &amp; Q." respecting the "Old Countess of
Desmond," who is said to have died at the age of 140; but there is a
still more remarkable instance of longevity recorded in the pedigree of
the Vernon family, and which seems to be too well authenticated to admit
of doubt. Sir Ralph Vernon, of Shipbrooke (Lysonsi<a id="Page_390"></a> <span class="pagenum">[390]</span> styles him
<i>Baron</i> of Shipbrooke, a barony founded by Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester),
who was born some time in the thirteenth century, died at the great age
of 150! and is said to have been succeeded by his descendant in the
sixth generation. He was called the "<i>Old</i> Sir Ralph," or Sir R. "<i>the
long liver</i>." His first wife was a daughter of the Lord Dacre; and in
1325 he made a settlement on the marriage of his grandson (or, as some
pedigrees represent, great-grandson,) Sir Ralph with the daughter of
Richard Damory, Chief Justice of Chester. This deed was the cause of
future litigation; and it is said that the papers respecting this
law-suit still exist, to prove the fact of the old knight's patriarchal
age. I would refer those who may be curious for further information on
the subject to Ormerod's <i>History of Cheshire</i>, where, in the pedigree
of "Vernon of Shipbrooke," they will find some account of "Old Sir
Ralph."</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>While on the subject of <i>longevity</i>, I may mention that in 1833, while
passing through Savoy on my way from Italy, I saw and conversed with an
old woman, who was then in her 119th year. It was at Lanslebourg, on the
Mont Cenis. Her name was Elizabeth Durieux, and the date of her birth
was the 17th of December, 1714, only four months after the death of
Queen Anne, and when Louis XIV. still occupied the throne of France. Her
age was well authenticated. In early life she had been in the service of
the then reigning family, and a small pension had been settled upon her,
which she had been receiving nearly a century; and, until within ten
years of the time when I saw her, she had been in the habit of
journeying on foot over the mountain annually to receive it. She had all
her faculties, with the exception of a slight degree of deafness; and
assured me that she could remember everything distinctly for one hundred
and twelve years! She was bony, large limbed, and appeared to have been
a tall strong woman formerly; excessively wrinkled, and very dirty. How
long she may have continued to live after I saw her in 1833, I know not.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE FALLACY OF TRADITIONS.</span>
</h3>

<p>Several communications to the "N. &amp; Q." have already proved how little
reliance is to be placed upon the traditions repeated by vergers and
guides to wondering lionizers. A collection of other instances, where
the test of science and archæological investigation have exposed their
falsity, would be interesting and instructive. In spite of Sir Samuel
Meyrick's judicious arrangement of the armour in the tower, the
beef-eaters still persist in relating the old stories handed down. At
Warwick Castle the rib of the dun cow is ascertained to be a bone of a
fossil elephant, and Guy's porridge-pot a military cooking utensil of
the time of Charles I. St. Crispin's chair, carefully preserved in
Linlithgow Cathedral by insertion in the wall, is of mahogany,&mdash;an
American wood! The chair of Charles I. at Leicester bears a crown,
which, having been the fashionable ornament after the Restoration,
together with the form, betrays the date. Queen Eleanor's crosses, it
now appears, were not built by her affectionate husband, but by her own
direction and with her own money. The fire-place and other objects in
belted Will's bedroom at Naworth Castle, are manifestly of later date.
The curious bed treasured up near Leicester as that occupied by Richard
III., immediately before the battle of Bosworth, is in the style
commonly called Elizabethan. Queen Mary's bed at Holyrood is of the last
century; and her room at Hardwicke is in a house which was not erected
till after her death; the tapestry and furniture, however, may have been
removed from the old hall where she was imprisoned. The tower of
Caernarvon Castle, in which the first Prince of Wales is supposed to
have been born, is not of so early a period. In short, archæologists
seem to show that there is not only nothing <i>new</i> under the sun, but
that there is also nothing <i>true</i> under the sun. To assume "a
questionable shape," may I request some of your correspondents to add to
the list?</p>

<h3>
<span>ON THE DERIVATION OF "THE RACK."</span>
</h3>


<p>Some time ago I ventured to call the attention of your readers to what I
regarded as an oversight of the commentators on Shakspeare, in reference
to a certain passage of the <i>Tempest</i> in which the word "rack" occurs.
It seemed to me that, with the exception of Malone, having overlooked
the construction of the passage, they had been misled by the authority
of Horne Tooke; for to every other part being conceded its due weight
and meaning, and assuming, with Horne Tooke, that Shakspeare understood
English at least as well as his commentators, I could not conceive it
possible that there could be a serious doubt as to the value of the word
in question. I have no wish, now, to say a word in addition upon this
point, firmly convinced as I am that the time will come when "(w)rack"
will be generally received by critics as it always has been by everybody
else, as the true reading; but I have a few observations to make on the
derivation of the word used by Shakspeare and others, with which it has
been so often identified, which I trust will be found worthy of a few
moments' consideration.</p>

<p>Horne Tooke is justly regarded as a very high authority, and certainly I
should be the last to deny how deeply philology is indebted to the
originality of his views; yet with the respect that<a id="Page_391"></a> <span class="pagenum">[391]</span> I entertain
for his labours, I see no reason why my judgment should abdicate its
place, even though its conclusion should be that he was not always
infallible. In considering the meaning of "rack" in the <i>Tempest</i>, I
treated the question entirely as one of construction, and therefore
allowed the supposed derivation of the same word in other places from
Recan, <i>to reek</i>, to stand unexamined and unquestioned; but let us look
now a little more closely into the matter, and I think I shall be able
to make it appear that this conclusion is not altogether so
unquestionable as many may have supposed. That the application of the
word may be more clearly seen, I beg leave to quote a few passages:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"That which is now a horse, even with a thought,</p>
     <p> The <i>rack</i> dislimns, and makes it indistinct</p>
      <p>As water is in water."</p>
<p class="author"> <i>Ant. &amp; Cleo.</i> Act IV. Sc. 12.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Far swifter than the sailing <i>rack</i> that gallops</p>
      <p>Upon the wings of angry winds."</p>

 <p class="author"> <i>Women Pleased</i>, Act IV. Sc. 1.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

           <p class="i5"> "Shall I stray</p>
     <p> In the middle air, and stay</p>
      <p>The sailing <i>rack</i>?"</p>

<p class="author"><i>Faithful Shepherdess</i>, Act V. Sc. 1.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"But as we often see, against some storm,</p>
      <p>A silence in the heavens, the <i>rack</i> stand still."</p>

<p class="author"> <i>Hamlet</i>, Act II. Sc. 2.</p>

</div>

  <p class="blockquot">   "The winds in the upper regions which move the clouds above
   (which we call the <i>rack</i>)."<br />
<span class="author1">Bacon, <i>Naturall Historie</i>.</span></p>

<p>Steevens, in reference to the last quotation, says, "I should explain
the word <i>rack</i> somewhat differently, by calling it 'the last fleeting
vestige of the highest clouds, scarce perceptible on account of their
distance and tenuity.' What was anciently called 'the rack' is now
termed by sailors <i>the scud</i>." It is sufficiently obvious from the above
what is meant by the word; but I now come to put the question, What
authority had Horne Tooke for deriving it from Recan? It is, in fact,
nothing more than a guess, the less probable as the word represents only
an indirect result&mdash;not the clouds themselves, but a peculiar effect
produced upon the clouds by the action of the winds. In another passage
(in which I recognise the hand of Shakspeare) the formation of the
<i>rack</i> is employed as an illustration; and in this instance "reek" would
hardly stand as a substitute for the verb used.</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "I might perceive his eye in her eye lost,</p>
    <p>  His ear to drink her sweet tongue's utterance;</p>
  <p>    And chasing passion, like inconstant clouds,&mdash;</p>
   <p>   That, <i>rackt upon the carriage of the winds,</i></p>
     <p><i> Increase, and die</i>,&mdash;in his disturbed cheeks."</p>

<p class="author">  <i>Edward III.</i>, Act II. Sc. 1.</p>

</div>

<p>From this it would appear that the <i>rack</i> is literally that which has
been <i>wrecked</i>, and that it should be derived from wrac, past part. of
wrikan, <i>to wreak</i>; in short, that <i>it is</i> identical with the word in
the <i>Tempest</i> in the general sense of <i>remains</i>; in the present case, in
its special application, meaning, as Steevens explains, "<i>the last
fleeting vestige</i><a id="ige4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of the highest clouds" previous to their final
disappearance. Had it ever been used with the general sense of <i>vapour</i>
or <i>exhalation</i>, or even generally for <i>a cloud</i> or <i>the clouds</i>, the
case would be different; but in fact, no examples can be produced by
which it can be shown that such was ever its meaning; and in the absence
of proof it will be noted as not a little remarkable that, <i>not</i> being
used to represent <i>the clouds</i>, which <i>already exist</i> in the form of
vapour or exhalations, it is only employed when a word is required
descriptive of an effect of their <i>dispersion</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn4"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#ige4" class="label">[4]</a> Indeed, the action of the winds is one and the same,
whether upon clouds on the face of heaven, or upon bodies at sea; and
the <i>wrack</i> of one and the other, broken into fragments, for a fleeting
space <i>remains behind</i> to tell the tale.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Substitution of the Letter "I" for "J" in the Names of "John,
James, Jane," &amp;c.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Will you permit me to ask the reason of the absurd,
and sometimes inconvenient, custom of substituting <i>I</i> for <i>J</i> in MS.
spelling of the names John, James, Jane, &amp;c.? If it be correct in MS.,
why is it not equally correct in print? Let us, then, just see how the
names would read in print with such<a id="Page_392"></a> <span class="pagenum">[392]</span> spelling: <i>Iohn</i>, <i>Iames</i>,
<i>Iane</i>, &amp;c.! Besides, if it be correct to put <i>I</i> for <i>J</i> in John, it
must, of course, be equally correct to put <i>J</i> for <i>I</i> in <i>Isaac</i>, and
to turn it into <i>Jsaac</i>. Indeed, if you happen in a subscription list,
or a letter, or anything else intended for the press, to write in the
MS. the letter <i>I</i> (which <i>rightly</i> stands as the initial in <i>that</i>
case), as the initial of some person named <i>Isaac</i>, it is ten to one but
the compositor substitutes <i>J</i> in its place in print. I have found Sir
<i>I.</i> Newton in my MS. thus metamorphosed into Sir <i>J.</i> Newton in print.
I see in "The Clergy List" more than one name which ought to be <i>I</i>,
turned into a <i>J</i>. Now, Sir, it is folly to pretend that <i>I</i> and <i>J</i> are
synonymous letters, or that they express the same meaning, unless we are
prepared to allow <i>Isaac</i> to be spelt with a <i>J</i> or <i>I</i>, according to
the writer's pleasure or caprice. May I, then, be permitted to ask
whether it is not high time for every one to <i>write</i> <i>I</i> when he <i>means</i>
<i>I</i>, and to <i>write</i> <i>J</i> when he <i>means</i> <i>J</i>? If compositors would always
<i>print</i> MSS. <i>as they are written in this particular</i>, the palpable
absurdity of putting <i>I</i> for <i>J</i> would, I am sure, soon be evident to
all, and soon shame people out of the fashion. What if <i>U</i> and <i>V</i> were
treated with as little ceremony as <i>I</i> and <i>J</i>? So it once was. Thus T.
Rogers, in his work on the Thirty-nine Articles, <span class="smaller">A.D</span>. 1586, will furnish
an example. In it we read: "Such is the estate principally of infants
elected <i>v</i>nto life, and sal<i>u</i>ation, and increasing in yeers." But this
old-fashioned mode of spelling has long become obsolete: may the
substitution of <i>I</i> for <i>J</i> soon become the same.</p>

<h4>
<span ><i>Daniel de Foe.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A son of Daniel shines in Pope's <i>Dunciad</i>. Does the
following notice refer to a son of that son? It is extracted from an old
Wiltshire paper:</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "On the 2 Jan. 1771, two young men, John Clark and John Joseph De
   Foe, said to be a grandson to the celebrated author of the <i>True
   Born Englishman, &amp;c.</i>, were executed at Tyburn for robbing Mr.
   F&mdash;&mdash;, the banker, of a watch and a trifling sum of money on the
   highway."</p>

<p>And the writer then proceeds to moralise on the inequality of that code
of laws, which could visit with death the author of a burglary committed
on another man, who, by the failure of his bank, had recently produced
an unexampled scene of distress, in the ruin of many families, and was
yet suffered to go scatheless.</p>

<p>My next notice, which is also extracted from a Wiltshire paper, is dated
1836.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "In a street adjoining Hungerford Market, there is now living,
   'to fortune and to fame unknown,' the great-grandson of the
   author of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. His trade is that of a carpenter,
   and he is much respected in the neighbourhood. His father, a
   namesake of this great progenitor, was for many years a
   creditable tradesman in the old Hungerford Market."</p>

<p>Has it ever been noticed by bibliographers that the <i>History of Robert
Drury</i>, which came out the year before <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, may have had
an equal share with Alexander Selkirk's story in forming the basis of De
Foe's narrative?</p>

<p>&mdash;During a visit to
Bolingbroke, a village in Lincolnshire, the birth-place of Henry IV.,
the rapidity of the little stream, so unusual in a county remarkable for
the sluggishness of its waters, suggested to me the probable origin of
the name, <i>bowling brook</i>; "bowling along," and "running at a bowling
pace," being not uncommon expressions. Here then, if we cannot meet with
"sermons in stones" amongst the few vestiges of the castle, and in the
church with its beautiful decorated windows, the heads of which are so
disgracefully blocked up with plaster, we may "find books in the running
brooks," and learn that "proud Bolingbroke" owed his appellation to this
insignificant babbling rivulet.</p>

but little fear of its gaining ground, having full confidence in the
good taste of our countrywomen: but it will be curious to see what our
ancestors of the seventeenth century thought of the wearers of the
aforesaid garment. Vide the Glossary to Beaumont and

  <p> "The translator gives the following verses, which are now well
   known. I suspect he is the author of them, having never seen them

<p>&mdash;In the north of Lincolnshire the sore mouth with which

<h3>
<span>SPEAKER LENTHALL.</span>
</h3>

<p>In a biographical notice (MS.) of Speaker Lenthall by the Rev. Mark
Noble, I find the following passage:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">   "His (Lenthall's) ancestor is mentioned in the will of Sir
   Richard Williams <i>alias</i> Cromwell. Sir Richard was the
   great-grandfather of Oliver Lord Protector. There was always a
   friendship between the family of Cromwell and that of Lenthall."</p>

<p>Can any one versed in Cromwellian lore kindly inform me if any such will
is in existence; and if so, what is its date? I should be glad to know
too if there is any further authority for the statement in the text,
that there was <i>always</i> a friendship between the Cromwells and
Lenthalls, assuming such friendship to have subsisted anterior to the
days of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>It is stated by Wood (<i>Athen. Oxon.</i>, article <span class="smaller">LENTHALL</span>), and repeated in
substance by Noble in his <i>Protectoral House of Cromwell</i>, that "two or
more" of the Speaker's son, Sir John Lenthall's speeches, "spoken in the
time of usurpation," are in print. Having hitherto failed in discovering
any trace of these speeches, I should greatly value any clue that may
direct me to them if still extant. On Noble's authority, when
unsupported, of course little reliance can be placed; but in any matter
of detail, or pure and simple fact, related by Wood, I have
considerable, though not altogether implicit, faith.</p>

<p>In a brief and singularly inaccurate memoir of Lenthall, in the <i>Lives
of the Speakers</i>, lately published by Churton, the following passage
occurs:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "We omitted to state in reference to Mr. Lenthall's strenuous
   exertions in favour of the gallant Earl of Derby, that Mrs.
   Cromwell, in one of her letters to the Protector, urges him to
   endeavour to effect a reconciliation with the Speaker," &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>

<p>As no authority is cited, I should be glad to learn where the letters of
Mrs. Cromwell thus referred to are to be found. Are they in print or
MS.? If any of your readers should be able to enlighten me in respect of
all or any of the above Queries, and would kindly do so either through
the medium of the Notes, or to my address as below, I should be greatly
obliged.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTTE OF IMBERCOURT, SURREY.</span>
</h3>



<p>I find that Robert Roper, Esq., of Heanor Hall, co. Derby, married ...
daughter of William Nott, Esq., of Imbercourt, co. Surrey, and had
issue, with other children, Rebecca; married first Sir William Villiers,
Bart., of Brooksby, co. Leicester, elder brother of George Villiers,
Duke of Buckingham; and secondly Capt. Francis Cave of Ingarsby Hall,
co. Leicester.</p>

<p>Can any one of your readers supply me with the Christian name of Robert
Roper's wife; and with the names of his other issue: also whether the
representation of this branch of the Roper family has devolved upon the
descendants of Rebecca Cave? I find in my mem. book a reference to
Dodsw. MSS. in <i>Bibl. Bodl.</i> 41. fol. 70., which I have no means of
consulting at present.<a id="Page_394"></a> <span class="pagenum">[394]</span></p>

<p>I find that William Notte, with Elizabeth his wife, his father-in-law
and mother-in-law, are buried at Thames Ditton, co. Surrey. Manning and
Bray's <i>Surrey</i>, vol. i. p. 463., contains the following passage:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "On a stone, or brass plates, are the portraits of a man kneeling
   at a table, and of a woman: behind the man are three sons; behind
   the woman, three daughters all kneeling, and underneath:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "'Here under lyeth the bodies of Robert Smythe, Gent., and
   Katheryn his wife, daughter to Sir Thomas Blount of Kinlett,
   Knyght, which Robert dyed the 3rd daye of Sept. 1539, and the
   sayd Katheryn dyed the x day of July, 1549.'</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "Below these, on the same stone, are also the portraits of a man
   with fourteen sons behind him; and a woman with five daughters,
   all kneeling; and underneath:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "'Here under lyeth the bodies of William Notte, Esquyre, and
   Elizabeth his wife, daughter to the above-named Robert Smyth, and
   Katheryn his wyfe; whiche William dyed the 25th day of Nov. 1576,
   and the sayd Elizabeth dyed the xv day of May, 1587.'</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "Above are the arms, Notte, on a bend between 3 leopards heads
   one and two, 3 martlets; crest, an otter with a fish in his mouth
   in a tussock of reeds.'"</p>

<p>Can any one of your readers refer me to any notice or pedigree of this
family of Notte, who were lords of the manor of Imbercourt in the parish
of Thames Ditton?</p>

<p>Can any one tell me to what family this Robert Smythe belonged? Was he
one of the Smythes of Ostenhanger in Kent? Was his wife Katheryne too
the daughter of Sir Thomas Blount by the daughter of Sir Richard Crofts
of Eldersfield? The History of the Croke family does not notice her
existence. And, lastly, would some one on the spot kindly inform me,
whether the above-mentioned brasses are still extant, and in
sufficiently perfect condition to admit of a rubbing being taken of
them?</p>

<h4>
<span ><i>Poison.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I should feel much indebted to any of your correspondents who
will inform me what is the true etymon of this word&mdash;the strict meaning
of the term originally&mdash;and when first used in our language?</p>

<p>However trifling this Query may at first sight appear, yet I am very
anxious to ascertain whether, originally, the term was applied
exclusively or principally to deadly agents operating on the body
<i>through the skin</i>, or an external wound, and not through the stomach?</p>

<p>The Greek word Toxicon is rendered "<i>venenum</i>," quod barbarorum
<i>sagittæ</i> eo illinebantur (Vide Diosc. Lib. <span class="smaller">VI.</span> cap. XX.) Again, Iòs,
jaculum, sagitta. Item, <i>venenum</i>, quod serpentes et cætera animalia
venenata ejaculatur. Horace uses the words "<i>pus</i> atque venenum," not to
express two different things, but merely to add force and point to his
satire; just as in like manner we read "crafts and subtleties" in the
Liturgy, or "a thief and a robber" in the Scripture.</p>

<p>Now, is it not probable that our word "poison" takes its origin from
this "pus?"</p>

<p>&mdash;In the <i>Critic</i> of February 2, 1852, p. 78.,
there is an excellent letter, written by a lady, in defence of female
doctors. In this letter Elizabeth Blackwell, M.D., is mentioned with
great respect. It appears, from the <i>Critic</i> of January 15, p. 45., that
Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell is an American lady, and graduated in some
American university, and that she was received with distinguished marks
of attention both in London and Paris, and especially at St.
Bartholomew's Hospital. Can any of your correspondents favour us with a

maintained; and in what instances they know that, when present, the lord

<h4>
<span ><i>Vikingr Skotar.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Mr. W. F. Skene, in his <i>Highlanders</i>, quotes <i>Ari
Froda</i> or Arius Multiscius for the assertion, that the Hebrides were
occupied, on the departure of Harold Harfagr, "by Vikingr Skotar, a term
which is an exact translation of the appellation Gallgael" (vol. ii. p.
27.). That is true, on the assumption that <i>Vikingr</i> is<a id="Page_395"></a> <span class="pagenum">[395]</span> not
Icelandic for pirate, but only for Scandinavian pirate; which assumption
I should doubt.</p>

<h4>
<span ><i>The Abbot of Croyland's Motto.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Will you allow me to call M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. L<span class="smcap lowercase">OWER'S</span>
attention to a passage in his <i>English Surnames</i>, vol. ii. p. 122., 3rd
edition, which he has passed over without comment, but which struck me
as requiring some editorial notice:</p>


  <p class="blockquot">"The motto of John Wells, last abbot of Croyland, engraved upon
   his chair, which is still extant, is:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "'Benedicite Fontes, Domine.'</p>
     <p> "'Bless the Wells, O Lord!'"</p>

</div>


<p>Reading "Domin<i>o</i>" for "Domin<i>e</i>" would make the first line of this
inscription plain enough, as a quotation from the canticle "Benedicite,
omnia opera;" but what are we to think of the second line? Could not the
worthy abbot have given the pun upon his name in English, without using
those particular words, or placing them in such a position that they
actually <i>look</i> as if they were intended as a translation, word for
word, of their Latin companions, in defiance of
 all the laws of grammar?</p>

<h4>

<h4>
<span ><i>Breezes from Gas Works.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;Why do secretaries to provincial gas
companies call small pieces of coke <i>breezes</i>; and why do they by
letters offer to sell "<i>breezes</i> at tenpence <i>per sack</i>?" My residence
is not far distant from the works of one of these <i>Æolian</i> gas
companies; and when the wind is in the east, I inhale <i>breezes</i> which my
senses tell me do not blow from "Araby the blest."</p>

<h4>
<span ><i>The Phrase "and tye."</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The clerk in a parish in the north-west part of
Sussex frequently makes use of an expression which I cannot
understand,&mdash;nay more, he is unable to explain it himself! The
expression is used by several of the old men in the parish, though by
none of them so often as by the clerk. "Well, master, how are ye
to-day?" He answers, "Middling, thanky'e <i>and tye</i>." He brings these two
words in at the end of most sentences. If you ask him whether there are
many people in the church, he will say, "Fairish number <i>and tye</i>;" or,
"No, not many <i>and tye</i>."</p>

tell the meaning of it?</p>

following inscription:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"buro + berto + beriora."</p>

</div>

<p>The ring is of a proper size for a man's finger, is plain, and rounded
on the outside. The words are on the inner side, which is flat. They are
well engraved, and very distinct. The character is the black letter of
the fifteenth century. Perhaps, through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," a
satisfactory interpretation of the three words may be obtained, which
has been long sought in vain.</p>

<h4>
<span ><i>'Prentice Pillars.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;"Deaths by Fasting," and "Genevra's Chest," have
reminded me of another tradition, no doubt equally groundless. It is
said by the vergers that one of the circular windows in the transepts of
Lincoln Minster was designed by an apprentice; and that the master,
mortified at being surpassed, put an end to his own existence. There is
another "'prentice window" at Melrose: a similar anecdote is connected
with two pillars in Roslyn Chapel. And there may have been many more of
these clever apprentices and foolish architects, but can one case be
substantiated?</p>

<span ><i>Archer Rolls: Master of Archery.</i></span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;In George Agar Hansard's <i>Book of

that "Her Gracious Majesty, Alexandrina Victoria" has her name inscribed
upon the <i>Archer Rolls</i>. Query, what are the Archer Rolls?</p>

<p>It is further said:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "That illustrious lady, in imitation of the warrior race of
   monarchs from whom she springs, has given a proof of real British
   feeling, by the appointment of a Master of Archery among her
   household officers."</p>


<p>I confess I can find no authority upon which this assertion is founded.
I have looked into the Calendar of the time, and have consulted officers
of the present household upon the existence of the office, without
success.</p>

concerning the practice of archery.</p>

"Mrs. Hicks and her daughter," who were executed at Huntingdon in 1716
for "selling their souls to the devil, making their neighbour vomit
pins, and raising a storm by which a certain ship<a id="Page_396"></a> <span class="pagenum">[396]</span> was <i>almost</i>
lost." I would wish to know whether there is extant any account of this
trial; I do not mean of the <i>result</i>, but whether I can anywhere meet
with any account of the trial itself; of the judge before whom it was
tried; the evidence, especially as to the ship which was <i>almost</i> lost;
and whether (what was observed upon in the answer of your correspondent
H. B. C. to some Queries about "Old Booty's Ghost") the time of the
crime being committed in Huntingdonshire, agrees with the position of
the ship at the moment.</p>

with Sir Walter Hungerford (through the King's mediation by letters) for
the marriage of Margery, one of Sir Hugh's grandchildren, to Edmund
Hungerford, son of Sir Walter. There was issue of this marriage, as I

<h4>
<span ><i>Where was Cromwell buried?</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It has been the belief of many that the
burial at Westminster Abbey was a mock ceremony, that in case a change
in the ruling powers should take place, his remains were deposited in a
place of greater security, and that the spot selected for his grave was
the field of Naseby. The author of <i>The Compleat History of England</i>
speaks of a "Mr. Barkstead, the regicide's son," as being ready to
depose&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"That the said Barkstead his father, being Lieutenant of the
   Tower, and a great confident of Cromwell's, did, among other such
   confidents, in the time of his illness, desire to know where he
   would be buried; to which the Protector answered, 'where he had
   obtained the greatest victory and glory, and as nigh the spot as
   could be guessed where the heat of the action was, viz. in the
   field at Naseby in com. Northampton.' That at midnight, soon
   after his death, the body (being first embalmed and wrapt in a
   leaden coffin) was in a hearse conveyed to the said field, Mr.
   Barkstead himself attending, by order of his father, close to the
   hearse. That being come to the field, they found about the midst
   of it a grave dug about nine feet deep, with the green-sod
   carefully laid on one side and the mould on the other, in which
   the coffin being put, the grave was instantly filled up, and the
   green-sod laid exactly flat upon it, care being taken that the
   surplus mould should be clean removed. That soon after the like
   care was taken that the ground should be ploughed up, and that it
   was sowed successively with corn."</p>


<p>The author further states that the deponent was about fifteen years old
at the time of Cromwell's death.<a id="Page_397"></a> <span class="pagenum">[397]</span></p>

<p>Some seven or eight years ago I visited the field of Naseby, and whilst
there I met by accident with the aged clergyman of Naseby. Our
conversation naturally referred to the historical incident that had
given so much interest to the spot; and finally we spoke of this very
subject. I remember his telling me that he had collected some very
important memoranda relative to this matter, I think he said, "which
proved the arrival of his remains at <i>Huntingdon</i>, on their road
<i>elsewhere</i>."</p>

<p>Has this subject been properly investigated? and has any research been
made which has led to a satisfactory decision of the question?</p>

<h3><span>THE EARL OF ERROLL.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 297.)</span></h3>

<p>I am somewhat of opinion that your correspondent P<span class="smcap lowercase">ETROPROMONTORIENSIS</span> is
correct, about this nobleman being by <i>birth</i> the first subject in
Scotland, only he has apparently omitted the word "hereditary" before
those of Great Constable of Scotland, or Lord High Constable of
Scotland. Indeed, some writers make him <i>by birth</i>, not only the first
subject in Scotland, but also in England. Dr. Anderson, the learned and
laborious editor of <i>The Bee</i>, at p. 306. of vol. v. of that
publication, in the article on James, Earl of Erroll, who died 3rd June,
1778, says:</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "As to rank, in his lordship's person were united the honours of
   Livingston, Kilmarnock, and Erroll. As hereditary High Constable
   of Scotland, Lord Erroll is <i>by birth</i> the first subject in Great
   Britain, after the blood royal, and, as such, had a right to take
   place of every hereditary honour. The Lord Chancellor, and the
   Lord High Constable of England, do indeed take precedence of him,
   but these are only temporary honours which no man can lay claim
   to <i>by birth</i>; so that, <i>by birth</i>, Lord Erroll ranks, without a
   doubt, as the first subject of Great Britain, next after the
   Princes of the blood royal."</p>


<p>It would appear that the personal appearance of Earl James was in good
keeping with his high rank. He was accounted the handsomest man in
Britain, and at the coronation of George III. he attended in his robes,
and by accident neglected to take off his cap when the king entered. He
apologised for his negligence in the most respectful manner; but his
majesty, with great complacency, entreated him to be covered, as he
looked upon his presence at the solemnity as a very particular honour.</p>

<p>The Earl of Erroll's charter of appointment to this high office, is
dated at Cambuskenneth, 12th November, anno 1316; and is still preserved
in the charter room of the family seat, Slains Castle, Cruden,
Aberdeenshire. The youthful inheritor of this high office is the Right
Honourable William Harry, Earl of Erroll, Baron Hay of Slains, Baron
Kilmarnock of Kilmarnock, in the county of Ayr, Captain in the Rifle
Brigade, born in 1823, succeeded his father, seventeenth Earl, in 1846.</p>

<h3>
<span>GENERAL WOLFE.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 438.; Vol. v., p. 185., &amp;c.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Although not affording answers to the Queries in Vol. iv., p. 438. <i>et
infra</i>, the following may not be uninteresting to your correspondent.
There is much concerning Wolfe in the <i>Historical Journal of Campaigns
in North America</i>, by Captain Knox, dedicated by permission to Sir
Jeffery Amherst, who commanded that part of the expedition against
Canada which, striking on the lower end of Lake Ontario, descended the
St. Lawrence to Montreal, whilst Wolfe, ascending the river, operated
against Quebec. Thus it appears that General and Sir Jeffery Amherst
were one and the same person. The frontispiece to the 1st vol. is a
portrait of General Amherst, that of vol. 2nd is a portrait of General
Wolfe; both so characteristic, that I should presume they are
likenesses, although no authority is given.</p>

<p>In 1828, I saw at Quebec the man who attended Wolfe as orderly-serjeant
on the day of his death;<a id="Page_399"></a> <span class="pagenum">[399]</span> and what may be considered a curious
coincidence was, that he bore the same name as Wolfe's mother, viz.
Thompson. Mr. Thompson was a very respectable and much-respected old
man; and, I believe, was occasionally a guest at the Governor's table.
He had a son in the Commissariat department, who is no doubt in
possession of all his father knew concerning Wolfe.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Thompson, Wolfe always addressed his men "brother
soldiers;" and their pet-name for him was, "The little red-haired
corporal." Thompson was not the only remnant of Wolfe's army in 1828, as
appears by the following:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "General Orders, Head Quarters, Quebec, 7th Aug. 1828. </p>

<p class="blockquot">"1. The Commander of the Forces is pleased to authorise the
   payment of a pension, at the rate of 1<i>s.</i> per diem from 25th May
   last, to Robert Simpson, a veteran, now ninety-six years of age,
   who fought on the plains of Abraham under Gen. Wolfe," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>


<p>On the 12th Jan. 1829, died at Kingston, U. C., John Gray of
Argyleshire, N. B., aged ninety-six. He had served at Louisburg, Quebec,
&amp;c. &amp;c. under Sir Jeffery Amherst and General Wolfe.</p>

<p class="right">A. C. M.</p>

<p class="left">Exeter.</p>


<p>I send the following extracts from the newspapers respecting Wolfe,
scarcely knowing whether it may be worth while. Such as they are, they
are at your service:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "Hoc ultimum opus virtutis edens in victoria c&oelig;sus."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"To the highest military merit undoubtedly belongs the highest
   applause, but setting aside the froth of panegyrick&mdash;</p>

   Minden, only by practising what was familiar to them?</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Who at Rochefort offered to make a good landing, not asking how
   many were the French, but where are they?</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Who, second then in command, was second to none in those
   laborious dangers which reduced Louisburgh?</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Who wrote like Cæsar from before Quebec?</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Who, like Epaminondas, died in victory?</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Who never gave his country cause of complaint except by his
   death?</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Who bequeathed Canada as a triumphant legacy?</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Proclaim, 'twas W<span class="smcap lowercase">OLFE</span>!"&mdash;<i>Newcastle Courant</i>, Oct. 27, 1759.</p>



<p class="blockquot">  "The late brave General Wolfe was to have been married on his
   return to England to a sister of Sir James Lowther, a young lady
   whose immense fortune is her least recommendation. She had shown
   so much uneasiness at the thoughts of his making his campaign in
   America, that nothing but the call of honour could have prevailed
   with him to accept of that command in the discharge of which he
   fell so gloriously."&mdash;<i>N. C. Journal</i>, 1759.</p>


<p class="blockquot">"His mother is, we hear, so much afflicted for the loss of her
   son that 'tis feared she will never get the better of her
   disorders. The inhabitants in her neighbourhood sympathised with
   her so much that they did not make any public rejoicings, lest it
   should add to her grief. Even the mob of London discovered by
   their behaviour the night of the illuminations for the victory,
   what they felt for so brave a man.</p>

<h3>
<span>JAMES WILSON, M.D.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 276. 329.)</span>
</h3>

<p>This writer will be one instance of the use of such an organ of inquiry
as "N. &amp; Q." M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY'S</span> reply to my Query reminds me of Wilson's
<i>History of Navigation</i>, with which I have long been acquainted: but I
had quite forgotten, or perhaps never remarked, that this Wilson was
<i>James</i>, and <i>M.D.</i> Baron Maseres reprinted the <i>History of Navigation</i>
in the fourth volume of the <i>Scriptores Logarithmici</i>: it is an
elaborate summary, of wide research, and puts the author's learning and
judgment beyond a doubt. Maseres, in his Preface, gives a mention of
Wilson, and, in addition to the facts now brought out, states, in his
own curiously explicit style, that Dr. Pemberton's <i>Epistola ad Amicum
J. W. de Cotesii inventis</i>, "was addressed to this Dr. James Wilson, who
was the person meant by the word <i>Amicum</i>, with the two letters <i>J. W.</i>,
which were the initial letters of his name." I happen to possess Brook
Taylor's copy of this <i>Epistola</i> (4to. 1722), and its Supplement (4to.
1723), in which Taylor has written, "E libris Br. Taylor, ex dono eximii
paris amicorum, autoris D. H. Pemberton atque editoris D. J. Wilson."
Thus it is established that the author of the dissertation on the
fluxional controversy appended to Robins's tracts, lived in friendship
with some of the most distinguished parties to that quarrel. It is also
established that he was fully conversant with the mathematics of the
day; for Pemberton's letter, called out by Wilson's own queries, could
have been read by none but a previous reader of Cotes and the highest
fluxionists. As to Wilson's age, he says (Robins's <i>Math. Tr.</i>, vol. ii.
p. 299.) he was a fellow-student<a id="Page_400"></a> <span class="pagenum">[400]</span> of Pemberton at Paris: the latter
was born in 1694, and the former was probably of nearly the same age.
They were close friends to the end of their lives, and Wilson published
Pemberton's <i>Course of Chemistry</i>, delivered at Gresham College, 8vo.
1771, according to Hutton and Watt. These last-named authorities both
attribute to Pemberton himself the dissertation on the fluxional
controversy in Robins's <i>Tracts</i>: but it certainly has Wilson's name to
it; or rather, it is said to be by the <i>publisher</i> (which we now call
<i>editor</i>) of the volumes. It is very likely that Pemberton gave help:
assuredly he must have been consulted by his intimate friend on facts
the truth of which was within his own knowledge. Accordingly, the
following assertions, made by Wilson, are not to be lightly passed over:
first (which also Robins assumes again and again), that <i>Newton</i> wrote
the anonymous account of the <i>Commercium Epistolicum</i> (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>,
No. 342.) usually attributed to Keill, which, in Latin, forms the
Preface to the second edition of that work. Secondly, that Newton wrote
the criticism on John Bernoulli's letter at the end of the second
edition. Thirdly, that Newton himself, and not Pemberton, omitted the
celebrated Scholium from the third edition of the <i>Principia</i>. Montucla,
in the second edition (1802, vol. iii. p. 108) of his <i>History of
Mathematics</i>, gives statements on these points from a private source, to
the effect that the notes of the original edition of the <i>Comm. Epist.</i>
were Newton's, and that the informant had seen the matter which was
substituted for the Scholium, in Newton's handwriting, among the
proof-sheets preserved by Pemberton. If Wilson were the informant, which
may have been, for Montucla's first edition was published in 1758,
Montucla must have confounded the two editions of the <i>Comm. Epist.</i> If
not, it must have been some one who did not draw his account from the
dissertation, in which there is nothing about the proof-sheets.
Montucla, however, has lowered the credit of his informant by making him
assert that the second edition of the <i>Principia</i> was managed by Cotes
and Bentley, without communication with Newton. This, which all the
world knows to be untrue of the book, is true of the prefatory parts;
and Wilson gives an account of Newton's dissatisfaction with those
parts. If Wilson were the informant, Montucla has again misunderstood
him.</p>

<h3>
<span>OLIVER CROMWELL.&mdash;THE "WHALE" AND THE "STORM" IN 1658.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 207.)</span>
</h3>



<p>B. B. may see, in the British Museum library, a tract of four leaves
only, the title of which I will transcribe:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "London's Wonder. Being a most true and positive relation of the
   taking and killing of a great Whale neer to Greenwich; the said
   Whale being fifty-eight foot in length, twelve foot high,
   fourteen foot broad, and two foot between the eyes. At whose
   death was used Harping-irons, Spits, Swords, Guns, Bills, Axes,
   and Hatchets, and all kind of sharp Instruments to kill her: and
   at last two Anchors being struck fast into her body, she could
   not remoove them, but the blood gush'd out of her body, as the
   water does out of a pump. The report of which Whale hath caused
   many hundred of people both by land and water to go and see her:
   the said Whale being slaine hard by <i>Greenwich</i> upon the third
   day of June this present yere 1658, which is largely exprest in
   this following discourse. <i>London, printed for Francis Grove,
   neere the Sarazen's head on Snowhill, 1658.</i>"</p>

<p>Surely after reading the above, your sceptical correspondent can no
longer hesitate to accept as a matter of veritable fact this story so
<i>very</i> like a whale.</p>

<p>Evelyn, who lived near Greenwich, and was most probably one of the
wonder-struck spectators of the huge monster of the deep which had been
so rash as to visit our shores, notes in his <i>Diary</i> under the
above-mentioned date&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "A large whale was taken betwixt my land butting on the Thames
   and Greenwich, which drew an infinite concourse to see it by
   water, horse, coach, and on foote, from London and all parts. It
   appear'd first below Greenwich at low water, for at high water it
   would have destroyed all y<span class="topnum">e</span> boates; but lying now in shallow
   water encompass'd with boates, after a long conflict it was
   kill'd with a harping yron, struck in y<span class="topnum">e</span> head, out of which
   spouted blood and water by two tunnells, and after an horrid
   grone it ran quite on shore and died. Its length was 58 foote,
   height 16; black skin'd like coach leather, very small eyes,
   greate tail, onely 2 small finns, a picked snout, and a mouth so
   wide that divers men might have stood upright in it: no teeth,
   but suck'd the slime onely as thro' a grate of that bone which we
   call whale-bone; the throate yet so narrow as would not have
   admitted the least of fishes. The extreames of the cetaceous
   bones hang downewards from the upper jaw, and was hairy towards
   the ends and bottom within side: all of it prodigious, but in
   nothing more wonderfull then that an animal of so greate a bulk
   should be nourished onely by slime thro' those grates."</p>

<p>Having disposed of this matter, I shall now turn my attention to the
great storm that immediately preceded the death of that "arch rebell
Oliver Cromwell, cal'd Protector," which, be it remembered, took place
on Friday the 3rd of September, 1658.</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "Toss'd in a furious hurricane,</p>
     <p> Did Oliver give up his reign."</p>

</div>

<p>So saith the witty author of <i>Hudibras</i>; and to these lines his editor,
Grey, adds the note&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">"At Oliver's death was a most furious tempest, such as had not
   been known in the memory of man, or hardly ever recorded to have
   been in this nation. (See Echard's <i>History of England</i>, vol.
   ii.) Though most<a id="Page_401"></a> <span class="pagenum">[401]</span> of our historians mention the hurricane
   at his death, yet few take notice of the storm in the northern
   counties on that day the House of Peers ordered the digging up
   his carcase with other regicides. (See <i>Mercurius Publicus</i>, No.
   51. p. 816.)"</p>

<p>Cotemporaneous proof of the occurrence is afforded by S. Carrington in
prose, and by Edmund Waller in verse.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Nature itself," says Carrington, "did witness her grief some two
   or three days before by an extraordinary tempest and violent gust
   of weather, insomuch that it might have been supposed that
   herself had been ready to dissolve ... all which is so lively set
   forth by the quaintest wit of these times (E. Waller), who
   expresseth it more elegantly and copiously than my rough prose
   can possibly reach to."

<p>The ensuing night, Carrington adds, was serene and peaceful. (See his
<i>Life of Cromwell</i>, 1659, p. 223.) Ludlow, in his Memoirs, also notices
the storm. On the afternoon of Monday, August 30, he set out for London.
He says:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "On the Monday afternoon I set forward on my journey (from
   Essex); the morning proving so tempestuous that the horses were
   not able to draw against it; so that I could reach no further

AUTHENTICATED INSTANCES OF LONGEVITY.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 178. 296.)</span>
</h3>

<p>O. C. D. has avowed himself incredulous as to the reality of the
reported remarkable ages of the old Countess of Desmond, Jenkins, Parr,
&amp;c., and he suggests that there should be unquestionable evidence of
such extraordinary deviations from the usual course of human life before
we credit them. I confess myself of the same way of thinking; and
perhaps my doubts have been strengthened from the circumstance, that,
although the longevity of members of the Society of Friends is well
known at the insurance offices, I do not recollect an instance of any
one attaining one hundred years in the United Kingdom. Upwards of ninety
is not uncommon, from eighty to ninety common; and more than one-third
of the whole deaths are from seventy upwards. There was a
well-authenticated instance of a "Friend" in Virginia, named William
Porter, who attained one hundred and seven years, who could hoe Indian
corn a year previous to his death; but it was considered a rare
occurrence in America.</p>

<p>As some of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." may be curious in such matters, the
following is an accurate statement of the ages at the time of death of
members of the Society of Friends in the past two years. The extra
number of females arises from the greater number of males who leave the
society, or are excommunicated or emigrate. The average duration of life
in these two years appears about 52 years 6 months 4 days. The number of
members in the society in the United Kingdom is computed at 19,000 or
20,000. In America they are far more numerous.</p>

<p>I noticed, within the last week, the following inscription on a
tombstone in Conway churchyard:</p>

<div class="center">

     <p class="noindent"> "Also, Here Lieth the Body of</p>
   <p class="noindent">Lowry Owens, the wife of</p>
     <p class="noindent">William Vaughan, who</p>
    <p class="noindent"> died May the 1st, 1766,</p>
      <p class="noindent">aged 192."</p>

</div>

<p>The round of the "9" was above the line; the figures were in their
natural places, and had evidently not been altered; but as the
inscription was remarkably clear for its age, the only explanation that
occurred to me was that it had been recut by some ignorant person, when
nearly defaced. Immediately above it was the following, referring, I
presume, to her husband:<a id="Page_402"></a> <span class="pagenum">[402]</span></p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>If so, and the age of Mrs. Vaughan be correct as stated, she must have
been nearly a hundred or so when married. Can any of your correspondents
living in the neighbourhood explain how the mistake arose?</p>

</h3>

<h4>
<span ><i>Haberdascher.&mdash;Hurrer</i></span>
<span > (Vol. v., p. 137.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;Precision is of great
importance in investigating the meaning of our ancient technical terms.</p>

<p><i>Haberdascher</i> was, I apprehend, the <i>generic</i> name of dealers in small
wares. Hats and caps were formerley called <i>hures</i> and <i>howves</i> or
<i>houfes</i>; and when haberdashers dealt in such articles they were <i>pro
tanto hurrers</i>. But as early as the time of Edward I. there were traders
called hatters, who were not haberdashers; and at a later period, when
the term hurrer was obsolete, there were "haberdashers of hats." In the
reign of Edw. IV. a curious petition was presented to Parliament, which
is not unworthy of being put upon your Notes. It sets forth&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "That whereas huers, bonnets, and cappes, as well single as
   double, were wont to be truly made, wrought, fulled, and thickked
   by the might and strength of men, that is to say, with hand and
   foot; and they that have so made, wrought, fulled, and thickked
   such huers, bonnets, and cappes, have well and honestly afore
   this gotten their living thereby, and thereupon kept apprentices,
   servants, and good household. It is so that there is a subtile
   mean found now of late, by reason of a Fullyng Mille, whereby
   more cappes may be fulled and thickked in one day than by the
   might and strength of four score men by hand and foot may be
   fulled and thickked in the same day: the which huers, bonnets,
   and cappes, so fulled and thickked by such mill, are bruised,
   broken, and deceivably wrought, and cannot by the mean of any
   mill be truly made."</p>


<p>The petitioners conclude by praying Parliament to impose heavy penalties
upon all who use the fulling mill, or who sell huers, hats, or bonnets
that have been "fulled or thickked" by means of any such mill. So early
did the antagonism between hand-labour and machinery prevail.</p>

<p>I doubt whether the more ancient name of <i>haberdasher</i> were <i>milainer</i>.
There were <i>haberdashers</i> at York in the time of Edward III., but no
<i>milliners</i>. In 1372 the <i>haberdashers</i> of London were separated from
the <i>hurrers</i>, with whom they had been previously associated. I should
be glad to have a reference to the use of the term <i>milainer</i>, as
applied to traders of any sort prior to the reign of Edward III.</p>

<p>I should also be obliged to any of your correspondents who will tell me
what was the description of trade or business carried on by <i>uphalders</i>
in former times.</p>

<h4>
<span ><i>Cou-bache</i> </span>
<span >(Vol. v., p. 131.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Halliwell's <i>Archaic Dictionary</i> the
word <i>balk</i> is interpreted, "a ridge of greensward left by the plough in
ploughing, or by design, between the different occupancies in a common
field." This is exactly the meaning of the word as it is commonly used
in Yorkshire at this day; but in a Yorkshire village with which I am
acquainted, we have the very phrase of the <i>Golden Legend</i>,
"<i>cou-bache</i>," (pronounced <i>skoo-bauk</i>, the prefix <i>s</i> being a not
infrequent corruption), as the name of a wide grassy road between
thorn-hedges, upon the verbage of which the milch cows of the villages
are pastured. This seems to be just the sort of place described in the
legend as the scene of Kenelm's murder. I need not add, that it is not
unusual to find pure Anglo-Saxon words retained in the rural dialects of
Yorkshire.</p>

<span ><i>Meaning of Groom.&mdash;M. F. Barrière</i></span>

<p>&mdash;Having some
reason to doubt the high editorial authority attributed to M. Barrière
by J. R. (Cork), I would request your ingenious correspondent to favour
us with references to one or two (or more, if not too troublesome) of
the "<i>frequent cases</i>" in which the <i>Quarterly Review</i> adopts M.
Barrière's statements.</p>

<p>The filthy <i>espièglerie</i> related by that very suspicious authority St.
Simon, of the Duchess of Burgundy, already sufficiently <i>incredible</i>, is
rendered <i>impossible</i> in J. R.'s version of "<i>administered to herself</i>."
St. Simon supposes no such legerdemain.</p>

<p>The <i>Groom of the Stole</i> is the first lord of the King's bed-chamber;
under a Queen the equivalent office and title is <i>Mistress of the

<h4>
<span ><i>Grinning like a Cheshire Cat</i></span>
<span > (Vol. ii., pp. 377, 412.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In one of
your early Numbers I have seen some Queries respecting the phrase
"Grinning like a Cheshire Cat." I remember to have heard many years ago,
that it owes its origin to the unhappy attempts of a sign painter of
that county to represent a lion rampant, which was the crest of an
influential family, on the sign-boards of many of the inns. The
resemblance of these <i>lions</i> to <i>cats</i> caused them to be generally
called by the more ignoble name. A similar case is to be found in the
village of Charlton, between Pewsey and Devizes, Wiltshire. A
public-house by the roadside is commonly known by the name of <i>The Cat
at Charlton</i>. The sign of the house was originally a lion or tiger, or
some such animal, the crest of the family of, I believe, Sir Edward
Poore.</p>

<p>&mdash;M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. J. H. P<span class="smcap lowercase">ARKER</span>, in his Query
respecting old town-halls, mentions the Town-hall of Weobly, in
Herefordshire, as an early example of timber-work. Similar examples
exist at Hereford, Ross, Ledbury, and Leominster, in the same country.
These buildings are all constructed upon the same plan, viz. a large
oblong room supported on wooden pillars; so that there is an open
covered space beneath, which is used for the purposes of a market. With
respect to the age of these buildings I can give no information; but
something might doubtless be determined, partly by records, and partly
by the internal evidence of the style of construction.</p>

<p>In reply to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. J. H. P<span class="smcap lowercase">ARKER'S</span> Query about Town-halls, I beg to say that
in Leicester there are still standing a Guildhall (part of which is
undoubtedly of a date as early as the middle of the fourteenth century)
and a County Hall, called "The Castle," similar to the old building at
Oakham. The foundation-walls of the latter are parts of the original
fabric, and one of the windows is clearly of the Transition period.</p>

<h4>
<span ><i>Edward Bagshaw</i> </span>
<span >(Vol. v., p. 298.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;W. B. inquires whether Sir Edward
Bagshaw, of Finglas, left other children besides two daughters; which
two he describes as married to Ryves and Burroughs respectively? and
whether Castle-Bagshaw, in the co. Cavan, took its name from this branch
of the family, with any other information concerning this Sir Edward?</p>

<p>I have looked into my Cavan MS. Collections, and I find from them that
Sir Edward Bagshaw had been, so far as I can at present see, an
adventurer of Cromwell's introduction, debentured on lands of Cavan,
viz. Callaghan, Tirgromley, Derrychill, Timhowragh, and seventeen other
denominations, which were thereupon erected into the manor of
Castlebagshaw, and whereon he built a castle: such I <i>suppose</i> the
origin of the manor and castle. It is more certain, and indeed on proof
before me, that he had one daughter named Anne, and married before 1654
to <i>Thomas Richardson</i>, of Dublin, Esq., who, having paid 600<i>l.</i> to Sir
Edward, he, for that consideration, and for the marriage, granted all
the premises to Richardson in fee, who assigned them in 1661 to four
different persons. One of these assignees was Ambrose Bedell, a son of
the celebrated William Bedell, Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh. Sir Edward
Bagshaw died about 1661, possibly just previous to this partition. His
latter days were I think passed at Finglas, in the description of which
locality, in my <i>History of the Co. Dublin</i>, I find this apposite notice
(p. 371.): "Under the communion table are flat tombstones of very
ancient date, <i>to the families of Bagshaw and Ryves</i>;" but their
position precluded my decyphering their evidence. Of the family of
Bagshaw I have in my Genealogical Collections various notices, as well
in this country as in Derbyshire and Staffordshire.</p>

<span ><i>Miniature of Cromwell</i> </span>
<span >(Vol. v., p. 189.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Miniatures of Oliver
Cromwell do not appear to be very rare. At least, in addition to those
which have been noted in your columns, I may state that I picked up at
Stockholm, a few years ago, a very well-executed miniature of the
Regicide, which was in all probability brought to Sweden by his
ambassador Whitlock. The miniature is very<a id="Page_404"></a> <span class="pagenum">[404]</span> small, is protected by
a thick glass, and is framed in an ornamented, richly gilt, copper
frame. It is, I think, painted in ivory, and is backed by a gilt copper
plate, on which is engraved, in characters apparently of the period,
"<i>Ol, Cromwáll</i>, Anno 1684." The accent over the <i>á</i> renders it probable
that setting and inscription are foreign. The painting itself gives the
features of Cromwell very exactly, and represents him in plain armour,
with a plain falling collar round the neck, and long flowing hair.</p>

<p><i>Slick</i> or <i>sleek stones</i> are used by curriers to remove wrinkles and
other irregularities in, and to smoothen the surface of hides and skins,
after they have been converted into leather by the tanner. The stone
which is considered to be the best for this purpose is quarried in the
neighbourhood of Kendal.</p>

<p>The currier's <i>sleek stone</i> is an oblong square plate, measuring six
inches in length by four inches in breadth, and half an inch in
thickness. One of the longer edges of the stone is fixed into a groove
in a wooden handle or stock, and hence it is also commonly called a
<i>stock stone</i>.</p>

<p>The leather being spread out upon a table, the stock is held in both
hands, and the opposite edge of the stone is pressed upon and rubbed
over the surface of the leather. In a subsequent part of the process of
currying the workman uses, in like manner, a <i>slicker</i> or <i>sleeker</i> made
of steel, and finishes his work with a glass <i>sleeker</i>.</p>

<span > (Vol. i., p. 92.; Vol. v., p. 319.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The weight
of this "ponderous tenor bell" is not mentioned; but there does not seem
to be any particular "obscurity," whatever there may be of strangeness
in the alleged mode of its transit by water. By the terms "mill-cog" of
the poetaster is doubtless to be understood the <i>cog-wheel</i> of the
miller, viz. that which more or less directly connects the motive agent
with the shaft carrying the stones. Persons who happen to have noticed
the large size and ponderous construction of the main cog-wheel in many
an ancient flourmill will easily imagine that if set afloat it would
carry a great weight; especially if prepared, as a missionary to the
Hudson's Bay territories told me a small cart-wheel was rigged to
transport him over the rivers, viz. by stretching a large skin over its
area. It was, in all likelihood, to some contrivance of this kind that
John de Dandelion and his dog have become so picturesquely and
permanently connected with the history of Margate in "traditionary
rhyme."</p>

<span ><i>Burial, Law respecting</i> </span>
<span >(Vol. v., p. 320.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Though not a lawyer, I
venture to express the opinion that, if preferred, burial may take place
in unconsecrated ground. The law exacts the registering of the death,
and inhibits a clergyman from officiating except within the consecrated
boundary. Indeed the burying-ground of dissenters is not consecrated
according to law, although it may have to be licensed. But, supposing a
person to have the fancy to lie "in some loved spot, far away from other
graves," there seems to be no legal difficulty. In the shrubbery of
Brush House, the residence of my friend and neighbour John Booth, Esq.,
M.D., there is a mausoleum over the remains of his uncle, from whom he
inherited the property.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Here," says Hunter, in his <i>History of Hallamshire</i>, "Mr. Booth
   spent the latter part of an active life in mathematical and
   philosophical studies; and, indulging a natural (?) and
   patriarchal desire, prepared his own sepulchre amidst the shades
   his own hand had formed, in which his remains are now reposing."</p>

<p>Was not Mrs. Van Butchell preserved many years after death in a glass

but were composed by a Protestant. Some of the lines were subsequently
altered by a Catholic lady, the late Mrs. Cholmely, of Brandsby Hall,
near York, and I believe the whole verses were printed at her private
expense. The line on Mary of England was, in the original, anything but
complimentary to the memory of that queen. Mrs. Cholmely's daughter, the
late Mrs. Charlton, of Hesleyside in Northumberland, had the verses
printed again at Newcastle, about twenty-five years ago. I have no doubt

<h4>
<span ><i>Suicides buried in Cross Roads</i> </span>
<span >(Vol. iv., pp. 116. 212. 329.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the
fifth chapter of the most remarkable Saga of Thorfinn Karlsefne, we find
some curious customs to have been prevalent in Greenland relative to the
burial of the dead in unconsecrated ground. Thorstein Erikson, the
second husband of Gudrida, died of a sore sickness. Many of the
household had previously been carried off by the same malady, and the
ghost of each corpse joined its fellows in tormenting and terrifying the
survivors. The night after Thorstein's death, his corpse rose up in the
bed and called for Gudrid his wife. With reluctance and terror the widow
approached the body of her husband.&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Now when Gudrid arose and went to Thorstein, it seemed to her as
   though he wept. And he whispered some words to her which none
   could hear, but these other words he spoke in a loud voice, so
   that all were aware thereof. 'They that keep the truth shall be
   saved, but many here in Greenland hold badly to this command. For
   it is no Christian way as here is practised, since the universal
   faith was brought to Greenland, to lay a corpse in unblessed
   earth, and to sing but little over it. It had been the custom in
   Greenland, after Christianity was brought in, that the dead
   should be buried on the lands where they died, in unhallowed
   earth, <i>and that a stake should be set up over the breast of the
   dead</i> (<i>skyldi setja staur upp af brjosti hinum dauda</i>); and when
   the priest afterwards came, the stake was pulled up, and holy
   water was poured into the hole, and they sang over the body even
   though it was long after.' And Thornstein's body was carried to
   the church in Eriksfiord, and there it was sung over by the
   priests (<i>yfirsöngvar af Kennimönnum</i>.")</p>

<p>May not this custom, which prevailed in Greenland in the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, have been derived from the Scandinavian north, and
there have been applied to the suicide buried in the cross road? Was the
idea of burying these outcasts in such a place, the hopeful one of
placing them at least under the shadow as it were of the cross, though
they were denied a resting-place in consecrated ground. That the old
Northerns regarded suicide with horror, we know from the "Eyrbiggia
Saga," p. 530. of Mr. Blackwell's edition of Mallet's <i>Northern
Antiquities</i>.</p>

<span ><i>Olaus Magnus</i> </span>
<span >(Vol. iii., p. 370.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have before me an English
version of this most singular writer, by J. S., printed by J. Streater,
London, 1658, 1 vol. folio, pp. 342. The marvellous description of the
sea serpent by Olaus Magnus is well known, but during the controversy
recently raised as to the reappearance of this monster to the officers
of the Dædalus, the following testimony to its existence in later times
was perhaps overlooked. It is extracted from the notes of Frederick
Faber, the celebrated Iceland ornithologist, describing a zoological
expedition to the islands in the Cattegat, and published in Oken's
<i>Isis</i> for 1829, p. 885.:</p>


 <p>  "As I was returning in a boat from Endelave to Horsens, the old
   helmsman, observing that I took great interest in natural
   history, asked me if I had ever seen the sea serpent. On my
   replying in the negative, he told me that about two years ago,
   while he and his companion were fishing near Thunoe, they
   observed the head of a large creature lying quite on the surface
   of the water, and in close proximity to their boat. The head was
   like that of a seal, though they immediately perceived that it
   belonged to no animal of that kind. A gull flew towards the
   monster, and made a pounce upon him, when the huge creature
   raised its body at least three fathoms high into the air, and
   made a snap at the bird, which flew away in terror. They had
   time, before it disappeared, to notice that the monster had a red
   throat, and that its body was about twice the thickness of a
   boat's mast."</p>

<h4>
<span ><i>The Word "Couch"</i></span>
<span > (Vol. v., p. 298.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The word is French: coucher par
écrit. Ménage says, <i>coucher</i>, in its common sense, is derived from
<i>collocare</i> in Latin, of which he gives instances as early as Catullus;
he might have gone back to Terence. Hence, says he, "coucher bien par
écrit, pour dire écrire avec ordre:" and quotes Salmasius, to show that
coucher par écrit answered to <i>digerere</i>, in the sense of writing a
digest.</p>

<p>The sense is the same as our expression "lay down," "lay down the law,"
&amp;c., but we do not confine that to writing.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>It is always a boon to historical literature when a man of learning and
industry devotes himself to a monograph of any particular person or
period. When we saw, therefore, in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, the able
and interesting papers by Mr. Cunningham, on the history of one who,
whatever might have been her life, so died, that Tennison did not
hesitate to preach her funeral sermon, we felt sure that those papers
could never be allowed to remain the "sole property" of the readers and
admirers of our good friend Sylvanus Urban; and we have proved right in
our anticipation. <i>The Story of Nell Gwyn, and the Sayings of Charles
II., related and collected</i> by Peter Cunningham, which has just been
issued, consists of a reprint of those papers, greatly enlarged and
increased in value by the information which has reached the author since
they appeared in their original form. We know of no volume of the same
extent calculated to give a more graphic or faithful picture of the
heartlessness and depravity of the age of profligacy in which his
heroine lived, an age which furnishes a striking proof how true it is
that individuals, communities, and even whole nations, will after a time
seek compensation for a state of gloomy and unchristian fanaticism in
one of unbridled licentiousness.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham has, in this handsomely illustrated volume, treated a
subject which required very nice handling with great tact; and his book
deserves to be placed on the shelves with Pepys and Evelyn, as a
necessary supplement to them. Can we give it higher praise? Its quaint
and characteristic binding is a clever fac-simile of the morocco binding
which Charles II. so loved.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the publishers of the <i>National Illustrated Library</i>
for a new memoir of the great founder of American independence. <i>The
Life of General Washington, First President of the United States,
written by himself; comprising his Memoirs and Correspondence, as
prepared by him for publication, including several Original Letters now
first printed</i>, edited by the Rev. C. W. Upham, forms two volumes, which
have been written or compiled on the principle, now we believe first
applied to Washington, of making the subject of the memoir, its far as
possible, his own biographer. This task Mr. Upham has executed with much
ability and excellent judgment; and we know of no work calculated to
give the general reader a better or more correct idea of the personal
character of one of whom the Americans boast, that he was "first in war,
first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen."</p>

<p>Some of our readers may be interested to know that the collection of
black-letter ballads, formerly in the Heber collection, and described in
the <i>Bibliotheca Heberiana</i>, vol. iv. pp. 28-33., was sold on Monday
last at the auction of Mr. Utterson's library at Messrs. Sotheby's.
After a rather brisk bidding, Mr. Halliwell became the purchaser at the
sum of 104<i>l.</i></p>

<p>In Lambeth Churchyard is a Monument, once handsome and elaborately
carved, which was erected in 1662 by the widow of JOHN TRADESCANT the
younger, to the memory of her father-in-law, her husband, and her son,
who were inhabitants of that parish.</p>

<p>The Monument of the TRADESCANTS, which was repaired by public
subscription in 1773, has now again fallen into decay. The inscription
also on the stone that covers ASHMOLE's grave, who was himself buried in
Lambeth Church, is now very nearly effaced. The restoration of that
Church, now nearly finished, seems a fit occasion for repairing both
these Monuments. It is therefore proposed to raise a fund for the
perfect restoration of the Tomb of the TRADESCANTS, according to its
original form, as represented in two drawings preserved in the Pepysian
Library at Cambridge, and also for renewing ASHMOLE's epitaph. The cost
will not be less than 100<i>l.</i>, and assistance is earnestly requested
from all who are anxious to preserve ancient monuments, especially those
who are following the same pursuits as the TRADESCANTS, and who are
daily deriving benefit and delight from the labours and discoveries of
these first of English gardeners and naturalists.</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "One of the most valuable and interesting pamphlets we ever

<p class="blockquot">"A small pamphlet in which he throws a startling light on the
   practices of modern Mesmerism."&mdash;<i>Nottingham Journal.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Dr. Maitland, we consider, has here brought Mesmerism to the
   'touchstone of truth,' to the test of the standard of right or
   wrong. We thank him for this first instalment of his inquiry, and
   hope that he will not long delay the remaining
   portions."&mdash;<i>London Medical Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">"The Enquiries are extremely curious, we should indeed say
   important. That relating to the Witch of Endor is one of the most
   successful we ever read. We cannot enter into particulars in this
   brief notice; but we would strongly recommend the pamphlet even
   to those who care nothing about Mesmerism, or <i>angry</i> (for it has
   come to this at last) with the subject."&mdash;<i>Dublin Evening Post.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"> "We recommend its general perusal as being really an endeavour,
   by one whose position gives him the best facilities, to ascertain
   the genuine character of Mesmerism, which is so much
   disputed."&mdash;<i>Woolmer's Exeter Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Dr. Maitland has bestowed a vast deal of attention on the
   subject for many years past, and the present pamphlet is in part
   the result of his thoughts and inquiries. There is a good deal in
   it which we should have been glad to quote ... but we content
   ourselves with referring our readers to the pamphlet
   itself."&mdash;<i>Brit. Mag.</i></p>

 <p>In addition to the testimonies borne to the singularly high Character of

published by a very competent Judge.&#8277;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Many words more suggest themselves: they contain I believe, every one
of them, in their derivation or their use, or in both, something that
will make it worth your while to acquaint yourselves with them; either
some fact of history, some custom of past times, some truth of the moral
and spiritual world, some lively and impressive image, or other
noticable circumstance about them. In most cases, RICHARDSON'S
DICTIONARY, the <i>only one</i> from which I can promise you effectual help,
for it is the only <i>English one</i>, in which Etymology assumes the Dignity
of a Science, will put you in the right position for judging why the
